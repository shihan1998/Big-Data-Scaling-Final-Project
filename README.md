**Big Data Scaling Final Project**

**1. Processing on Sample Data with 33K Observations**
   
   1.1 Drop redundant features
   
   1.2 Remove missing values
   
   1.3 Feature Engineering on categorical variables
   
   1.4 Data splitting with 70% training and 30% testing, and standardization scaling

**2. Model Building and Prediction**

   2.1 Gini index computation
   
   2.2 Data splitting
   
   2.3 Selecting the best split point
   
   2.4 Selecting class for terminal node
   
   2.5 Recursively splitting child node
   
   2.6 Building final model with above steps
   
   2.7 Model prediction
 
 **3. MapReduce**
 
   3.1 Cut data into chunks
   
   3.2 Model training on each chunk
   
   3.3 Combine models together into one
   
   3.4 Predict and compare the results and time with non-MapReduce
   
 **4. Experiment on Larger 100K synthetic dataset**
